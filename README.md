<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

- You can go to my personal portfolio to see this and other projects and to my github account
  to check the code;
- This was a challenging one, I had to apply so many features in Javascript such as folding and unfolding the display search, displaying the information in the page according the cities and the number of guests to make the page work, and so on.
- I've learned more about the application of JS to give life and interactivity to the page
